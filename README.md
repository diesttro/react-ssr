# React Server-Side Rendering

A baseline to render a React application on server-side.

It was created for learning purposes and may be useful if you are trying to do server-side rendering.

## Usage

Before starting it's necessary to build the client and server.

```
npm run build
```

Once build is done you can start the server.

```
npm run start
```

You can also make changes on the client or server and view them without repeating the above steps.

```
npm run dev
```

You can replace the client folder with your React application and try. You may need to touch the client configuration to add loaders depending on your code.
