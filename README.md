# React Server-Side Rendering

A baseline to render a React app on server-side.

Note that depending on your app needs you may have to add loaders and other stuff.

## Usage

Before start make the client and server build.

```
npm run build
```

Once done run the server.

```
npm run start
```

Furthermore make changes on the client or server and view them with a single command.

```
npm run dev
```
