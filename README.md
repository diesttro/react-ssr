# React Server-Side Rendering

A baseline to render a React application on server-side

## Usage

You need to build the client and server before all

```
npm run build
```

Once done you can start serving requests

```
npm run serve
```

You can make changes to the client or server and view them without repeating the steps above

```
npm run start
```
